# Time Capsule Front-End

The Time Capsule app is a collection of user uploaded documents.  The purpose of the app is to give users a place to upload documents that they deem important to the current day.  Each document is tied to one of the below categories:
- Business
- Entertainment
- Health
- History
- Lifestyle
- Politics
- Science
- Sports
- Technology
- Cats
Files are uploaded to AWS and metadata is stored in a Mongo back-end.  Users can download the files from all users, but only have the ability to update and delete the files they've uploaded.

## Approach
The first day of the project we spent on planning.  We worked together on all of the following tasks to ensure the whole team was on the same page:
- writing user stories
- designing wireframes
- developing ERD
- discussing git strategy
- developing roles and responsibilities
- defining our work processes

### User Stories
We developed our user stories within Trello:<br>

### Wireframes and ERD
TBD - need links

### GIT Strategy
We created a dev branch and a series of feature branches.  We tried to ensure that only one person was working on a feature branch at a time to avoid conflicts.  We worked together as a group to run through all merges, resolve merge conflicts and do initial testing/bug fixes after each.  We followed the strategy of merging features into dev as they were completed, the rebasing our feature branches with the new dev branch.

### Roles and Responsibilities
We shared coding responsiblities, but each had a specific role to play as well.
- **Brandon -** Front-End Lead - Has the final say regarding front-end decisions.
- **Caleb -** Back-End Lead - Has the final say regarding back-end decisions.
- **Kosta -** Scrum Master/QA - Leads scrum meetings and performs QA for git related activities.  Responsible for heroku deployment.
- **Kara -** Team Lead - Organize team activities, take notes during meetings
